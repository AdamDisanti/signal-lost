# Design reference

Source: [Game Design Document.docx](reference/Game%20Design%20Document.docx), supplied by the project lead. This is a summary of design intent, not a record of implemented features. Read the original before gameplay decisions. The current user specifies six team members and Unity 6000.6.2f1 with Universal 3D/URP.

## Core experience

A low-poly first-person action-adventure shooter with exploration, goofy alien creatures, and light suspense. The stranded mechanic uses a directional scanner with signal strength and audio feedback to find ship scraps and encounters. The mining laser is the sole planned story weapon, using charge/cooldown rather than magazines. Scrap funds equipment/stat upgrades and merchant purchases. Enemy AI uses idle, chase, attack, and dead states, with expanded boss behaviors.

The flask heals without a fixed use limit; excessive drinking affects visibility and can cause blackout and checkpoint respawn. Cavendish the capybara gives optional quests; the hermit crab becomes a merchant. Per-biome progression includes three mini encounters before the boss becomes scannable; the document allows an early boss fight at much higher difficulty. Previous ship parts gate later biomes.

| Area | Planned boss / reward |
| --- | --- |
| Crash site tutorial | Recover laser/flask; learn movement, scanner, combat, resources, and healing |
| Desert / Dunes | Technology-enhanced hermit crab / Engine Core |
| Fog Forest | Nest Guardian / Navigation Computer |
| Crystal Caverns | Crystal-infused Cave Beast / Flight Control Module |
| Return to crash site | Cavendish in a mech / Reactor Core |

Win by recovering all four components, defeating the bosses, repairing the ship, and escaping. Levels are handcrafted. HUD includes health, scanner direction/strength, scrap, and objectives. Planned options include control adjustments, audio, save, and quit. Mouse/keyboard is planned; controller support is conditional. Playtesting metrics include play time, deaths, biome times, boss attempts, and resource collection.

## Scope as written

**Prototype:** tutorial, healing, one biome and boss, basic weapon skill tree, HUD/settings, and basic merchant/quest systems.

**MVP:** tutorial plus four playable levels, four bosses, scanner, mining laser upgrades, enemy state machines, quests/merchant, repair ending, settings/UI, and saves.

**Stretch:** enemy variants, extra upgrades/weapons, collectibles, boss phases, storytelling, and alternate endings including the 100% casino ending. Extra weapons are a stretch idea that conflicts with the sole-story-weapon statement; do not treat them as core scope.

The source proposes an eight-week sequence: foundation/prototype (weeks 1–3), biome/progression work (3–6), finale and save integration (6–7), then testing/polish/submission (7–8). Calendar dates are not supplied.

## Clarifications before implementation

- Source roster names five people; current team size is six. Sixth member, responsibilities, and all GitHub usernames are pending.
- Respawn location is described both as biome entrance and last checkpoint. Confirm checkpoint placement and what progress/resources persist after death or blackout.
- Clarify whether the tutorial crab, merchant, and desert boss are the same creature or separate characters.
- Confirm what counts toward the three encounters and how optional quests assist scanner/boss discovery.
- Define laser charge/cooldown values, flask intoxication thresholds/recovery, and save triggers before implementing them.
- The mining laser is provisionally a melee tool with a charged shot (see [combat prototype](combat-prototype.md)): left click is a three-swing combo, holding right click charges a bolt whose damage scales with hold time, and a short cooldown follows each shot. This replaces the earlier hold-to-fire beam with an overheat meter. The design document's "charge/cooldown rather than magazines" wording is read here as charge-to-fire plus a shot cooldown. Confirm the rule and values with the lead after playtesting.
- Clarify how the finale's stolen components affect inventory/progression and the ship repair ending.
- Lawson requested a burnt-rock basin for laser placement and an exit gate as [tutorial graybox props](graybox-props.md). The gate's unlock conditions and destination are unspecified; the delivered gate is an open visual frame, not a progression or scene-transition system.
- Lawson requested replacing the box-shaped tutorial environment with a dark rocky [impact site](tutorial-impact-site.md): a broad crater, scattered ship debris, modest hills, and the existing rocket partially buried at its center. The existing terrain slopes were explicitly approved and retained; this environment adds no checkpoint, quest-order, collectible-debris or exit-unlock rules.

- The latest tutorial art request doubles terrain width/length to 320 x 320 meters, preserves ship/debris sizes, adds a laser visual in the basin and requires impassable natural perimeter cliffs. The closed cliff ring is scenery/collision, not an exit-unlock mechanic. Confirm how the existing gate will eventually transition to the next area; no cliff opening, teleport or progression rule was invented. The placed laser has no new pickup/equip behavior.

These are unresolved questions, not blockers for repository setup or permission to choose new gameplay rules.
